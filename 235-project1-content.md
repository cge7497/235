Four options, separated by fractional units. "Start" "Proposal" "Game" "Documentation"
To space them evenly, they all may have to be the same amount of characters so I may just add spaces.

## Go off, hero!
<!--The game window will be centered, and surrounded a randomly colored background based on the color scheme of the original Atari game.
Though only if I can figure out how to do this well. Seems kind of possible.!-->

## Current Progress
